Sulley is a fuzzer development and fuzz testing framework consisting of multiple extensible components. Sulley (IMHO) exceeds the capabilities of most previously published fuzzing technologies, commercial and public domain. The goal of the framework is to simplify not only data representation but to simplify data transmission and target monitoring as well. Sulley is affectionately named after the creature from Monsters Inc., because, well, he is fuzzy.
